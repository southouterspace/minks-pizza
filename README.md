# Mink's Pizza — Online Ordering Platform

A complete online ordering platform for a single pizzeria: a public storefront
where customers browse the menu, customize pizzas, and place pickup/delivery
orders, plus an operator dashboard for menu management, store settings, and a
live orders inbox.

Payments are intentionally **not** captured yet — orders are persisted with
`payment_status = 'pending'` and the checkout path has a clean seam where
Stripe will slot in (see [Stripe readiness](#stripe-readiness)).

## Stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router, Server Components, Server Actions), TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — minimal Vercel-style design system
- **Neon Postgres** + **Drizzle ORM** (`@neondatabase/serverless` over HTTP)
- **Auth**: email + password for the operator (bcrypt), jose-signed JWT session cookie

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in values (see below)
npm run db:push              # create tables in your Neon database
npm run db:seed              # optional: store settings + starter pizzeria menu
npm run dev
```

`.env.local`:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `MINKS_DATABASE_URL` (or `DATABASE_URL`) | Neon Postgres connection string. `MINKS_DATABASE_URL` wins when both are set. |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | 32+ byte hex secret for session cookies (`openssl rand -hex 32`) |

## The two sides of the platform

### Operator (`/admin`)

1. Visit `/admin` — on first run you're redirected to **/admin/setup** to create
   your operator account.
2. **Menu** — create categories, items, and prices; attach modifier groups
   (Size, Crust, Toppings…); toggle availability to 86 an item instantly.
3. **Modifiers** — reusable option groups with required/optional rules
   (`minSelect`/`maxSelect`) and per-option price deltas.
4. **Settings** — store identity, hours, pickup/delivery toggles, prep times,
   delivery fee/minimum, tax rate — and the **Publish** switch that takes the
   storefront live (before that, customers see a coming-soon page). A separate
   **Accepting orders** switch pauses ordering without unpublishing.
5. **Orders** (`/admin`) — live inbox that auto-refreshes; move orders through
   `new → confirmed → preparing → ready → completed` (or cancel).

### Customer (`/`)

Menu browsing with category navigation → item customization dialog (sizes,
crusts, toppings with live price updates, quantity, special instructions) →
cart (persisted in localStorage) → checkout (pickup/delivery, contact details,
address for delivery, tip presets, order notes) → order confirmation page with
a live status tracker.

All pricing is authoritative server-side: the cart submits only item/modifier
ids, and the server re-validates availability, modifier rules, delivery
minimums, and recomputes every price at order time.

## Stripe readiness

- Money is integer cents everywhere; `orders` carries a full breakdown
  (subtotal, tax, delivery fee, tip, total) and `payment_status`
  (`pending`/`paid`/`refunded`).
- `src/lib/orders.ts` → `createOrder()` is the single seam: create a
  PaymentIntent for `totalCents` there, store its id, and flip
  `payment_status` from a Stripe webhook. `placeOrder` in
  `src/app/(store)/actions.ts` already returns a structured result to which a
  client secret can be added.

## Project layout

```
src/
  db/            schema.ts (Drizzle), seed.ts, index.ts (client)
  lib/           menu.ts, orders.ts (pricing + creation), auth.ts, validation.ts
  app/(store)/   customer storefront (menu, cart, checkout, order status)
  app/admin/     operator dashboard (orders, menu, modifiers, settings)
  components/    cart context, storefront + admin UI
```
