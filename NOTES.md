# Mink's Pizza — Build Notes

Working log + decision record for the online pizza ordering platform build.
Maintained continuously during the autonomous build session (2026-08-12).

## Goal

A fully functioning online pizza ordering platform:
- **Operator** can set up their menu and store, then publish it to customers.
- **Customers** browse the public menu, customize pizzas, build a cart, and submit
  orders — everything up to (but excluding) payment capture. Checkout is
  Stripe-ready: orders are persisted with `payment_status = 'pending'` and the
  submission path has a clean seam where a Stripe PaymentIntent will slot in.

## Stack decisions

| Concern | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16.3 (App Router, already scaffolded) | Repo convention; AGENTS.md mandates reading bundled docs first (breaking changes vs 14/15) |
| Database | Neon Postgres — project `misty-violet-36824705`, branch `main`, db `neondb` | Available connector; serverless-friendly |
| ORM | Drizzle + @neondatabase/serverless | Type-safe, SQL-first, works over HTTP |
| Auth (operator) | Email + password (bcryptjs) with jose-signed JWT session cookie | Single-tenant admin; no external IdP dependency |
| Cart | Client-side (localStorage + React context), re-validated server-side on order submit | Standard practice; server is source of truth for prices |
| Styling | Tailwind v4, Vercel-like aesthetic (white/near-black, Geist, 1px borders, minimal) | Requested |
| Payments | Not captured in v1. `orders.payment_status='pending'`, checkout server action isolated in `src/lib/orders.ts` for Stripe insertion later | Requested seam |

## Architecture

- `/` + `/menu` — public storefront (menu browsing, item customization modal, cart)
- `/checkout` — customer details, order type (pickup/delivery), tip, submit
- `/order/[id]` — order confirmation / status page
- `/admin` — operator dashboard (orders inbox, menu CRUD, store settings)
- `/admin/setup` — first-run operator account creation (only when no operator exists)
- `/admin/login` — operator sign-in
- Store publish state gates the storefront: unpublished → "coming soon" page.

## Data model (v1)

- `operators` — admin accounts (email, password_hash)
- `store_settings` — singleton row: name, tagline, phone, address, hours (jsonb),
  order types, prep times, delivery fee/minimum, tax rate, `is_published`,
  `is_accepting_orders` (pause switch)
- `categories` → `menu_items` (base_price in cents, availability toggle = 86'ing)
- `modifier_groups` (required/optional, min/max select) → `modifiers` (price delta);
  junction `item_modifier_groups`. Sizes are modeled as a required single-select
  modifier group — keeps one mechanism for sizes/crusts/toppings.
- `orders` — status flow `new → confirmed → preparing → ready → completed`
  (+ `canceled`), order_type, customer contact, money columns in cents,
  `payment_status` ('pending' until Stripe lands)
- `order_items` — denormalized snapshots (name, unit price, chosen modifiers as
  jsonb) so menu edits never corrupt past orders

## Work log

- [x] Scaffold Next.js 16.3 + Tailwind v4 (create-next-app)
- [x] Neon project created: `misty-violet-36824705` (us-west-2)
- [x] Deps: drizzle-orm, @neondatabase/serverless, drizzle-kit, zod, bcryptjs, jose, tsx
- [x] Research agent dispatched: industry UX/feature research (Domino's, Slice, Toast, Square…)
- [x] Docs agent dispatched: Next.js 16.3 breaking-changes brief from bundled docs
- [x] Drizzle schema + migration pushed to Neon
- [x] Seed script (demo menu: classic pizzeria categories/items/modifiers)
- [x] Operator auth lib (bcrypt + jose sessions)
- [x] Admin dashboard (built by subagent: setup/login, orders inbox with legal
  status transitions, menu CRUD with 86-toggle/reorder, modifier groups with
  radio-default semantics, settings with publish + pause switches)
- [x] Storefront: menu, item customization dialog, cart (localStorage)
- [x] Checkout: details + validation + order creation (Stripe-ready seam)
- [x] Order confirmation/status page with live polling
- [x] Order pipeline test: pricing exact (subtotal 4048¢ case), missing-required-modifier and delivery-minimum rejections verified against live DB
- [x] README
- [x] Admin flow review (auth coverage: 22 requireOperator calls across
  protected actions; legal status-transition map verified) + tsc + eslint clean
- [x] Operator e2e (Playwright): first-run setup → orders inbox → confirm order
  → menu page → settings → **publish via UI switch → storefront went live** →
  sign out → re-login. PASSED
- [x] Customer e2e re-verified on the published store; mobile (375px)
  screenshots verified (bottom-sheet dialog works well)
- [x] Production build passes; prod server smoke-tested (all routes 200)
- [x] Handoff state reset: operators table emptied, is_published=false —
  owner gets the pristine /admin/setup → build menu → publish journey.
  Demo orders #1001–#1002 left in the inbox intentionally.
- [x] Final push

## Gotchas hit (for future sessions)

- Playwright `getByRole(name:)` is substring-matching: "Publish store" also
  matched the "Unpublish store" switch — use `exact: true`.
- Next dev-tools floating indicator overlapped the admin sidebar footer and
  intercepted e2e clicks → `devIndicators: false` in next.config.ts.
- `create-next-app`'s root `src/app/page.tsx` silently shadows a route-group
  `(store)/page.tsx` for `/`.
- Pre-installed Chromium requires `executablePath: /opt/pw-browsers/chromium`
  (version pin mismatch with the npm playwright package).

## Decisions & findings

- 2026-08-12: Container restarted once mid-session; disk survived, background
  agents had to be relaunched. Note: keep commits frequent.
- `.env*` is gitignored by the scaffold — `DATABASE_URL` + `SESSION_SECRET` live in
  `.env.local` (documented in README; `.env.example` committed).
- Money is always integer cents. Tax computed at checkout from
  `store_settings.tax_rate_bps` (basis points) to avoid float drift.
- The sandbox pre-sets a stale ambient `DATABASE_URL` that `.env` files can't
  override → app reads `MINKS_DATABASE_URL` first (`src/db/url.ts`).
- Scaffold's `src/app/page.tsx` shadowed `(store)/page.tsx` for `/` — removed.
- Hours are informational (viewer-local clock, no store TZ column in v1);
  order intake is governed by the operator's publish + pause switches. Server
  enforces: published, accepting, order-type enabled, delivery minimum.
- Test order #1001 exists in the dev DB (useful for admin inbox demo).
- Industry research landed (docs/RESEARCH.md): build validated on guest
  checkout, server-side pricing, modifier architecture, 4-stage tracker.
  Acted on: double-submit guard, recent-order link. Deferred to roadmap:
  half-and-half, per-size topping pricing, SMS, delivery zones, allergens.
- Customer e2e (Playwright, real Chromium): menu → customize (Large/Thin/
  Pepperoni+Mushrooms = $20.24 ✓) → cart → checkout → confirmation #1002 ✓.
- Handoff state plan: after operator e2e passes, delete the test operator row
  and set `is_published=false` so the owner experiences pristine first-run
  setup (/admin/setup → build menu → publish). Demo orders stay for the inbox.
